this file is the project on visualizing retweet network diagraph by using the obamacare json data file.  

For the limit of the file's size, I upload the 2 processed data files `.RData` in google drive. You can skip the R code processing the json data and directly use `load()` to read in equivalent R object.

If you want to try processing the raw data. Please notice that the changing of the file name and you don't have to unzip the .zip file manually.It will take several minutes to run the programming,so be patient.
